module 100 # INS

#purpose: run a small TGV case to have a quick confirmation that the code and Postproc are ok
#do not change the parameters, create another case if needed !!!

#time integration parameters

restart 0 # if 1, reads file restart_file_number and begins from it
          # if 0, reads start_time model time (floating point) and starts from initial cond.
#restart_file_number 4
start_time 0.0  # only for restart 0, initial model time
end_time  25.0 # end model time


fixed_step 0 # 1: time step is fixed; 0: it is a fraction of the maximum
# fdt ...
exact_savepost 1 # if one, a smaller time step is forced to match exactly next savepost_time
savepost_time 2.5 # every savepost model seconds, a post proc file is saved

wtime_restart 200 # every wtimeRestart wall time seconds, a new restart is saved

info_step 10 # every info_steps time steps, more information is printed
