#time integration parameters

restart 0 # if 1, reads file restart_file_number and begins from it
          # if 0, reads start_time model time (floating point) and starts from initial cond.
#restart_file_number 4
start_time 0.0  # only for restart 0, initial model time
end_time  25.0 # end model time


fixed_step 0 # 1: time step is fixed; 0: it is a fraction of the maximum
